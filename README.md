# randomloadouts
A Google App Engine website to generate random TF2 loadouts. Currently hosted [here](http://randomloadouts.boatcake.net/). To update, run `python2 makecache.py`. You'll need a Steam API key which you can get [here](http://steamcommunity.com/dev/apikey). Either put the key right in the script or in a file `~/.steamapikey`.
